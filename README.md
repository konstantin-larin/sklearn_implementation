# sklearn_implementation
In this repository, I will learn the implementation of machine learning algorithms from the best.

# How I will do this?
I'll be reading their user guide - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html and take notes in my notebooks.
Also I will look at the implementation in their repository https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/ and rewrite the code with my comments (without cython)
